# DSP Project
#### C++ implementation of real-time DSP

This is to try out somethings I've learned in my Audio Processing course.

The goal is to create a functional real-time processing and synthesis.
+ Basic synthesis
+ Filters
+ Delay
+ Reverb

The first stage will be in pure C++, hopefully as a standalone with a GUI. With time, it might be ported to JUCE.

As of now, the first focus will be on implementing different effects offline (rendering them, instead of real time).
