#### C++ implementation of real-time synthesizer

This is to try out somethings I've learned in my Audio Processing course.

The goal is to create a functional real-time synthesizer that can operate with some basic waveforms,
filters, delay, reverb, and possibly othe forms of synthesis and effects.

The first stage will be in pure C++, hopefully as a standalone with a GUI. With time, it might be ported to JUCE.
